## An Book List created from HTML/CSS and JavaScript

During my time in the Odin Project, I undertook the most challenging project of my studies: creating a web application to store a user's book collection. The app features cards displaying each book's title, page count, author, and reading status. The objective was to enhance my object-oriented programming (OOP) skills using JavaScript. I found the project to be both enjoyable and motivating, leading me to pursue additional OOP projects to continue practicing and strengthening these skills. I strengthened the following skills:

**HTML**
* Form creation and validation

**CSS**

* Using the Grid layout
* Responsiveness using min-max
* Using the Flexbox layout
* Use of transitions

**JavaScript**
* Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
* DOM Manipulation
* Capturing and storing user input

### User Instructions
    1. User loads onto the page and clicks "Add Book"
    2. A form will pop up and the user should fill it out
    3. Once submit is clicked, a card will populate the grid on the screen
    4. The user then can add or delete more books
